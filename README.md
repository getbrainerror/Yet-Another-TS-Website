# Yet-another-Teamspeak-Website WIP
This Project is Work-in-Progress.
You shouldn't use it yet

Stuff that should work:
- Teamspeak Server Status
- List Groups on Sidebar
- Site bone
- Login (only the login, not the register part)
- Display News from Mysql and split the news to multiple pages

Stuff that is planned:
- An better Serverbrowser than the TS3 Libary
- User login
- Verify your user with your ts ident
- A news System, where user (or user groups) can add entrys
- An group assigner for teamspeak3 Groups (Should be usable without user login, via PM Code and IP comparison)
- Registered users can select additional Teamspeak Groups
  registered -> Can select group yxc
  verified -> Can select group zyx  
  any added group -> Can select group qwe
- A banner generator for the ts server (Server Status, and if specified an user online note)
- Set rules which can be shown at the ts verification
- Impress and privacy site for dsvgo conformity
- Multi language
